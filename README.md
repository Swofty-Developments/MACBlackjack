So as you might be able to see, I did have a very interpretive idea of "similar UI/UX experience", but hey, hopefully it looks good right!! Anyhow the functionality is basically exactly what is given, except with the addition of a music picker. Portions of the website, such as the main menu, are inspired by the design of tetr.io, and that is also where the soundtrack is from. No artwork is directly taken from tetr.io though!

The stack is very simple, with me using Firebase for both its auth and database through Firestore, and Vercel for hosting. TailwindCSS and Next.js are used as the frameworks/libs within the website. Additionally the entire website is mobile-responsive, hope you enjoy!
